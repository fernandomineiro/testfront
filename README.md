# Social media dashboard with theme switcher

This is my second submission for the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-6oY8ozp_H) based on the live coding session of [Leonidas Esteban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K4zonaIrV8)

Developing this project helped me review the process to create an application using the create-react-app CLI, the use of React hooks and to understand more about the media query "prefers-color-scheme"

Demo [here](https://citlallidmg.github.io/social-media-dashboard-react/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
